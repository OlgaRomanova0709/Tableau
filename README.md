# Tableau Assignment - Citi Bike Analytics

## Goal

**To aggregate the data found in the [Citi Bike Trip History Logs](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) to build a data dashboard, story, or report. I choose different  timespans - summer (June2019,July2019,August2019), winter(December2018,January2019,February2019),also November2019 and November2018. I've got summer and winter data by merging 3 months through python.**
Here is the main questions I observed, but I dived into the most interesting area to elicit several anomalies.
* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

* By what percentage has total ridership grown? 

* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months? 

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

* How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?

* How does the average trip duration change by age?

* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan? 

* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

**Additionally, I build the following visualizations:**

* A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

* If you're working with a merged dataset: a dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) -- with commentary pointing to any interesting events that may be behind these phenomena.

**Lastly, as a chronic over-achiever I performed the following:**

* Found at least two unexpected phenomena in the data and provided a visualization and analysis to document their presence.
